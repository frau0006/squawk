<div class="main">
    <h1>Test Blog Post!</h1>
    <h2>2020-10-09</h2>
    <p>
        If everything works properly, then the content of this will get stuck on the front page, and the rest will be
        rendered into a standalone page under the blogs folder, and a link will be placed into the blog index. I'll also
        have it so that on the blog index, the latest post will appear at the top.
