        Just making sure I didn't miserable mess everything up by copy-pasting from the blog builder script. I could probably
        figure out some way to consolidate all the functions into just one file, since they do nearly the exact same thing,
        only difference is they have some different tags "code" vs. "blog" and they also have different literal text for titles
        etc.
