        My name is Cole but you can remember me as spekk, spekkboy, whatever, and this is my cool and good website! I'm a college student currently studying computer programming, and I've got some very rudimentary experience, namely in C++. I'll be expanding my skillset formally with Java, and then (independently) in Python, Shell-scripting and the brave world of windows PowerShell. (PowerShell is actually being used to generate these very pages!)
    </p>
    <p>
        This site is handwritten HTML with scripts to cobble all the chunks together. The site is static, and I aim for it to be small, snappy and provide you a JS-Free Guarantee(tm). If you look at the bottom corner, that time stamp is automatically updated by the cobbler script! (The year in 2020-**** is too! Though I could probably afford to do that manually once a year...) The site may be barren now, but I hope to soon fill it with some Fresh Content :3 Until then, maybe look at the links top-and-center for some things I've already done!
    </p>
</div>
<div class=header><h1>latest from blogs</h1></div>
<div class="main">
    <h1>Test Blog Post!</h1>
    <h2>2020-10-09</h2>
    <p>
        If everything works properly, then the content of this will get stuck on the front page, and the rest will be
        rendered into a standalone page under the blogs folder, and a link will be placed into the blog index. I'll also
        have it so that on the blog index, the latest post will appear at the top.
    </p>
</div>
<div class=header><h1>latest from codeworks</h1></div>
<div class=main>
    <h1>Test Codeworks Post!</h1>
    <h2>2020-10-09</h2>
    <p>
        Just like the blog posts, a similar thing will be done with the codeworks pages.
