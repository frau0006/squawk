		<p>	A particular 30-year-old Floridian Linux Boomer once
			said that anyone with something to say should have their
			own personal website, so I made one.
		<p>	My name's Cole! Some people call me Spekk, too. :)
			I'm a programming student who has changed majors twice
			in two years. Acquianted with C++ since ca. 2013, I'm
			now expanding my knowledge base in technology onto Java,
			HTML/CSS, Bash scripting and the wonderful world of VIM.
