        Go fullscreen for that way cool website experience :o

        My name is Cole but you can remember me as spekk, spekkboy, whatever, and this is my cool and good website!
        I'm a college student currently studying computer programming, and I've got some very rudimentary experience, namely in C++.
        I'll be expanding my skillset formally with Java, and then (independently) in Python, Shell-scripting and the brave world
        of Windows PowerShell. (PowerShell is actually being used to generate these very pages!)
    </p>
    <p>
        This site is handwritten HTML with scripts to cobble all the chunks together. The site is static, and I aim for it to be
        small, snappy and provide you a JS-Free Guarantee(tm). If you look at the bottom corner, that time stamp is automatically
        updated by the cobbler script! (The year in 2020-**** is too! Though I could probably afford to do that manually once a year...)
        The site may be barren now, but I hope to soon fill it with some Fresh Content :3 Until then, maybe look at the links
        top-and-center for some things I've already done!
    </p>
</div>
<div class=header><h1>latest from blogs</h1></div>
<div class="main">
    <h1>Another Test Blog Post</h1>
    <h2>2020-10-10</h2>
    <p>
        The scripting session is going well so far. Everything is working in order for <i>one</i> file, let's see how
        it holds up with two! The expected output is that there will be two entries in the blog list and this one will
        appear under the "Latest Blog" section.
    </p>
</div>
<div class=header><h1>latest from codeworks</h1></div>
<div class=main>
    <h1>Test Codeworks Post Number Two</h1>
    <h2>2020-10-10</h2>
    <p>
        Just making sure I didn't miserable mess everything up by copy-pasting from the blog builder script. I could probably
        figure out some way to consolidate all the functions into just one file, since they do nearly the exact same thing,
        only difference is they have some different tags "code" vs. "blog" and they also have different literal text for titles
        etc.
