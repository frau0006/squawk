		<p>	A particular 30-year-old Floridian Linux Boomer once
			said that anyone with something to say should have their
			own personal website, so I made one. Right now the
			mental image I have of this site can be illustrated by
			someone flinging a black garbage bag into the woods.
		<p>	My name's Cole! Some people call me Spekk, too. :)
			I'm a programming student who has changed majors twice
			in two years. Acquianted with C++ since ca. 2013, I'm
			now expanding my knowledge base in technology onto Java,
			HTML/CSS, Bash scripting and the wonderful world of VIM.
		<p>	Now as I sit at home, waiting for the woohoo pandemic to
			blow over, I adventure into my social-media
			detoxification process, endeavours of self-mastery and 
			trying way too hard not to get absolutely memed by le 
			chad stoicism.
		<p>	The people they ask me: "Cole where do you want to be
			in 10 years?" and I say: "very big garden." And then the
			people they ask me: "Cole who do you think you are?" and
			I go "NOOOOOOOOO STOP MAKING ME CONSUUUUMMMMEEEEEEE" and
			then they say "shut yuor up idiot!!" and i say "ok"
		<p>	They shall say, "Why would you make this website?" and I
			shall wisely respond: "In a non-canonical Gospel, Jesus
			was once approached by a man who asked him: Rabbi, why
			are you throwing car batteries into the sea? And Jesus
			replied: the sea is right here, and I don't want them."
			The logic is very similar.
