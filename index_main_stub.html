        My name is Cole but you can remember me as spekk, spekkboy, whatever, and this is my cool and good website! I'm a college student currently studying computer programming, and I've got some very rudimentary experience, namely in C++. I'll be expanding my skillset formally with Java, and then (independently) in Python, Shell-scripting and the brave world of windows PowerShell. (PowerShell is actually being used to generate these very pages!)

        This site is handwritten HTML with scripts to cobble all the chunks together. The site is static, and I aim for it to be small, snappy and provide you a JS-Free Guarantee(tm). If you look at the bottom corner, that time stamp is automatically updated by the cobbler script! (The year in 2020-**** is too! Though I could probably afford to do that manually once a year...) The site may be barren now, but I hope to soon fill it with some Fresh Content :3 Until then, maybe look at the links top-and-center for some things I've already done!
