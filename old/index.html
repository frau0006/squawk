		<h1>Welcome!</h1>

			style="margin:0 20px 20px 0" alt="Protrait Placeholder">
		<p> I'll upload an actual Protrait of me at some point but
			right now it's woohoo virus time and my hair looks bad
			so nothing's going up until that gets taken care of.</p>
		<p>	A particular 30-year-old Floridian Linux Boomer once
			said that anyone with something to say should have their
			own personal website, so I made one. Right now the
			mental image I have of this site can be illustrated by
			someone flinging a black garbage bag into the woods.</p>
		<p>	They shall say, "Why would you make this website?" and I
			shall wisely respond: "In a non-canonical Gospel, Jesus
			was once approached by a man who asked him: Rabbi, why
			are you throwing car batteries into the sea? And Jesus
			replied: the sea is right here, and I don't want them."
			The logic is very similar.</p>
		<p>	My name's Cole! Some people call me Spekk, too. :) And I says,
			says I, just use Windows or macOS. It just werks.
			Linux was never a good destop environment. It's passable as
			a Facebook machine. Keep it on the serverside or just put it
			in a VM or something. Trust me bro it isn't worth it using it
			as your daily driver unless you're far gone schizo afraid of
			the botnet or you run PC hardware that's like 13 years old and 
			Linux is the only solution for security updates.</p>
		<p> VIM too. Learn VIM all you wish. Learn the keybinds, get gud
			at it. But don't get pressured into using it as your everthing
			machine. Dude it's [Current Year] stop larping like you're at
			Bell Labs in the 70s writing primitive C on a PDP-11 over a
			dumb-terminal. Just use vsCode or Atom or something idk lol.
			It's taken long enough to realize but if you're a total n00b
			then trying to be some like, cryptic code wizard because you
			do everything in a plain-text terminal is silly. Get gud at
			being a code normie before you try to be a code wizard. You
			should still learn VIM though, it's just an a-OK skill.</p>
		<p>	This website intends to be my repository of written
			things I feel are worth publishing. It's a sort of
			journal where I can organize my thoughts into an alright
			looking medium, and very hopefully I avoid posting
			cringe because I'm very suseptible to posting cringe.</p>
